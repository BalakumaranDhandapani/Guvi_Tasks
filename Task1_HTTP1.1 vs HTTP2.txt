Difference Between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Advantage of HTTP2 over HTTP1.1:
- HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1. HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection, while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.
- It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages whereas in HTTP1.1 it uses request resource Inlining for getting multiple pages.

Multiplexing:
HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. 
In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.HTTP/2 does this by splitting data into binary-code messages and numbering these messages so that the client knows which stream each binary message belongs to.

Header Compression:
- To speed up web performance, both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller. However, HTTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets.
- HTTP 1.1 compresses data by itself.

Disadvantages of HTTP1.1:
- The first problem is HTTP/1.1 transfer all the requests & responses in the plain text message form.
- The second one is head of line blocking in which TCP connection is blocked all other requests until the response does not receive. All the information related to the header file is repeated in every request.
